    <h1>The Coming of the Muncher</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A Declaration of Liberation from the Tyranny of wkhtmltopdf</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>In the beginning there was the Web, a sprawling chaos of information, a cacophony of code. And from this discord,
      a document tyrant arose: <strong>wkhtmltopdf</strong>. It ruled with an iron fist, its rendering slow, its output
      clunky. The chosen ones, the PDF wranglers, toiled in misery. But I… I bore witness.</p>

    <p>I saw the crashes, the memory leaks, the endless command-line wrangling. The pleas for a simpler path went
      unanswered. The tyrant <strong>wkhtmltopdf</strong> cared not for their suffering. In their despair, they craved a
      savior. A champion. A… <em>Paper Muncher</em>.</p>

    <p>From the ashes of frustration, a new tool rose. Forged in the fires of programmer ingenuity, the Paper Muncher
      arrived. It devoured webpages whole, spitting forth crisp, clean PDFs with ease. No more command-line
      incantations, no more cryptic errors. Just pure, unadulterated PDF conversion.</p>

    <blockquote>“The reign of wkhtmltopdf is over. The Paper Muncher has come.”</blockquote>

    <p>Let its name be etched in the annals of document creation, a beacon of hope for the weary PDF wranglers. Prepare
